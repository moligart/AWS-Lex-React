# AWS Lex with Custom React Front-End: [AskNadia ChatBot](http://asknadia.net)

## Notes

This is a simple AWS Lex chat bot experiment. Also an attempt to annoy my girlfriend. It worked.

## Buzzwords and stuff

### Serverless
[AskNadia ChatBot](http://asknadia.net) is serverless thanks to a combination of AWS S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

### Front-End
React, because component-based frameworks are the new heat.

### Back-end
Node.js running as Lambda functions. DynamoDB table used to analyze and improve the bot over time.
